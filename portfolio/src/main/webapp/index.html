      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have been obsessed with startups for as long as I could remember. 
        Tech has the potential to do so much for so many people. I always 
        have a side project I'm working on or an industry I'm looking into. 
        I've failed many times but learn so much from each leap I take. My only 
        goal is to help the world as much as I can through whichever companies 
        I join or make.
        <br>
        I first got into tech and computer science through my love for video games.
        Every time I opened up a console or computer it killed me not knowing how it worked.
        So I did what every programmer does and I Googled the things I didn't know. I found
        apps that would teach me C and C++ while my parents drove me to soccer practice, I
        joined my schools computer science team and began competing, and then I started
        reaching out to startups around me.
        <br> <br>
        Every moment of every internship I have ever had has stuck with me. I remember volunteering
        for nonporfits to develop their websites, working remotely for a startup based in a garage
        in Silicon Valley, working in a cramped room in the 5th story of an old newspaper building
        that a local startup rented out. Yet, even though I knew so little when I first started 
        working at these jobs when I was high school, even though I was overwhelemed by all that
        I didn't know, I got obssessed. I love working on cutting edge technology, building things
        that no one has built the world, changing the world (or at least trying to). I found new 
        internships as I grew more capable: building out IoT systems for one of Polaris's factories 
        and working at Apple Retail as a tech expert. High school was an incredible learning experience
        for me, and I am greatful that I was able to find my passions so early on. However, even 
        though working at these companies gives me incredible joy, I have found true fullfillment when
        starting my own things. That's why I always have a side project that I am working on, something to
        dream with.
        <br> <br>
        Now I am currently a sophomore at Duke University studying Computer Science and Physics. This past 
        summer I just finished my most recent internship with Facebook doing mobile development as part of 
        their Freshman/Sophomore internship program. In between classes I do machine learning research 
        developing automated fact checking solutions with my Databases Professor, Jun Yang. I am involved 
        with Chi Psi and DSP, social and professional fraternities I am a part of. I am a part of Duke's 
        Student Founders Program working on developing some of the startup ideas I have into companies. And 
        I am currently working on writing a sci-fi novel as part of a publishing program run by the Creator 
        Institute.
        <br> <br>
        Aside, from my obsessions with work, startups, and tech I have found several pastimes
        that I fill the freetime I have with. I love playing chess wtih anyone who is willing to play. I've 
        played soccer since I was 5 years old and, even though I don't play as much anymore, I would never give 
        up the chance to play another rec game. I'm an aspiring ping pong player who is more bark than bite.
        And I'm obsessed with sci-fi, movies and novels alike. I still get chills with I think of Interstellar or
        the Three Body Trilogy.
